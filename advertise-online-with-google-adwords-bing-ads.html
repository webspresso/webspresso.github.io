</strong></p><p>If you're looking for an effective (and cost-effective!) way to advertise your business via the Web, you'll find that advertising on Google and Bing with PPC ads is a great marketing strategy. Today, we'd like to share lots of important information about this type of advertising and its key benefits.
</p><p>Lots of entrepreneurs are using PPC on Google and Bing in order to make the most of their business prospects and you can do it, too!
</p><p>Without further ado, let's talk about what this type of advertising is and how it will work for your company or personal brand ...
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is PPC Advertising, Anyway?
</strong></p><p>If you're new to the world of pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, which may also be referred to as cost-per-click advertising (CPC), then you should know that it's a Web-based model for advertising which is utilized in order to move traffic to websites. With PPC advertising, the advertiser will pay a publisher, such as Google or Bing, when an ad gets clicked on. Websites may also offer pay-per-click ads.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Advertise on Google and Bing?
</strong></p><p>Most agencies which design and implement PPC campaigns for their clients advertise on Google and Bing. You may choose one or both of these platforms for your PPC ads and you'll also have the power to set up your own pay-per-click campaign if you don't want to outsource the task!
</p><p>Bing Ads and Google Ads are the platforms for setting up these pay-per-click campaigns. Each are a bit different. With Google, it's possible to become a Google Ads Partner by following some steps and getting certified. This is something that you may want to consider if you're interested in the cachet of being a bona fide Google Partner!
</p><p>With Bing, you may outsource your Bing PPC campaign to a <a href="google-ads-wirral.html">Bing Accredited Professional Agency</a> or become accredited through the search engine yourself.
</p><p>Regardless of how many credentials you want or whom you hire to take care of things for you, the overarching goal of the PPC-focused entrepreneur is to locate new sales leads via these popular search engines! Both Bing and Google offer step-by-step instructions on how to set up pay-per-click campaigns. If you're not going to pay an agency to take care of this type of ad campaign, you'll benefit from boning up on PPC rules and strategies via official Google and Bing web pages.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Clicks Lead to Greater Business Success
</strong></p><p>If you set up a PPC campaign and an interested search engine user notices your ad and clicks on it, he or she will be directed to your website. The client may then learn about your company and he or she may decide to convert. A conversion means money in your pocket.
</p><p>Even clients who don't convert right away will gain knowledge of your brand and may come back later in order to buy. Also, a visitor to your website who arrives there via a PPC may sign up for your newsletter and become a prospective client who may be warmed for a sale.
</p><p>Getting web traffic is so important. It's the lifeblood of e-commerce. Running PPC campaigns via the world's most popular search engines is definitely a great way to attract more Web traffic fast. Also, you'll only need to pay when an ad is clicked on.
</p><p>This is a sensible business model. You'll pay when an ad hits the target with a search engine user. Also, even people who don't click may learn more about your website from an ad and store that knowledge away for later, and you won't need to pay in order to plant those seeds of interest in their minds!
</p><p>As you can see, this type of campaign will offer tons of benefits. It will boost exposure, bring interested people right to your website and allow you to pay only when ads are clicked on. Also, PPC campaigns for Google and Bing are easy to customize in order to target the right customers, using the right keywords. You may tailor the size and scope of your campaign to your budget and requirements. So, these marketing initiatives are rather versatile and adaptable choices!
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The difference between PPC and SEO
</strong></p><p>PPC is about placing ads and then paying when they get clicked on. SEO is search engine optimisation and it's about using processes and marketing techniques in order to strengthen Google and Bing search engine rankings. Actually, SEO is about boosting rankings in all search engines!
</p><p>So, although most entrepreneurs run PPC and SEO initiatives simultaneously (there are exceptions, though), they aren't the same. SEO should be a constant. PPC may be constant or occasional. PPC is about turbo-charging Web traffic. SEO is about search engine rankings. Understanding the difference is important.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is Google Ads?
</strong></p><p>Google Ads is a program which allows people to get their ads on Google. Ads will be viewed by customers at the precise moment when they are looking for the things that you sell via the Google search engine. You'll only pay Adwords when a person clicks on your ad in order to move to your website. You'll pay "per click" and get plenty of welcome exposure!
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why choose a Google Partner?
</strong></p><p>Google Ads is a rock-solid choice as a platform for your PPC ads. It's the ultimate online backdrop, because it's the biggest search engine on the planet. If you want to hit your targets, retain your clients and boost your earnings, while also drawing in new customers, choosing Google will be a great decision!
</p><p>Bing is great, too, but Google has the edge in terms of popularity (Google attracts approx 9 times the traffic that Bing does, but there's also a lot more competition, meaning you pay more for each ad click). We think that PPC ad campaigns across both platforms cover all of the bases, so it's not really necessary to choose unless you want to. If you do want to choose, Google may be the most logical choice. However, on the flip side, many entrepreneurs find that running PPC campaigns on Bing costs less.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is PPC Right for You?
</strong></p><p>Now that you know some sensible reasons to advertise on Google and Bing with PPC ads, why not get the ball rolling today? It may be the key to unlocking the full potential of your website!
